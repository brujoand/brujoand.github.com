I'm a Norwegian Software Engineer, weight lifter, hobby psychologist, metal head
and I love to automate things. For the last few years I've been helping Tech
companies implement DevOps best practices. At home I'm a husband, a dad and I
build things for fun and not so much profit.

For this blog I'll be keeping things short and to the point. There will be no
ads, because who has time for that anyway. There is a Google analytics tag
though, so I can see how many people visit this blog.

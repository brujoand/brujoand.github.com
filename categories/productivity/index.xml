      <description>tl;dr Remapping caps lock to control and escape on Linux
The elephant on the keyboard Nothing good has ever come from pressing the CAPS LOCK key, either accidentally or intentionally during a heated discussion on IRC.

For my day to day stuff, the things I actually check regularly a simple checklist is more than enough.</description>

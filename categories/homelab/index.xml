      <description>So from my post about replacing my doorbell with a security camera you might have noticed that I have a accumulated quite a few PoE security cameras that I use with Frigate to get object detection and fancy integrations with Home-Assistant. The part I didn&amp;rsquo;t go into detail about was the struggle with my latest cameras, the [Reolink 820a](https://reolink.com/product/rlc-820a/].
So on the surface these cameras are great. They look nice, support power over Ethernet, doesn&amp;rsquo;t rely on a cloud service and are very simple to set up.</description>

      <description>So my door bell ran out of battery, and I started wondering if I could use my security camera instead. In retrospect I could have gotten some batteries from the battery drawer, but where is the fun in that!?
So a while back I bought a bunch of Hikvision and Reolink Power over Ethernet (PoE) 4K security cameras. I like them because they only need one wire and have great quality builds for the price.</description>

      <title>Using custom hardware in kubernetes</title>

      <description>One major difference between running k8s in a corporate setting vs running in a homelab is the extreme amount of custom hardware you end up wanting to put into the cluster. But this isn&amp;rsquo;t really how k8s was meant to be used. Any workload should be able to run anywhere, and be killed at any time and pop back up again. At least, for the most part. But I wanted to do some machine learning in my cluster using Google Coral TPU.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t like having to relying on other people&amp;rsquo;s computers, aka the cloud, so when I can I selfhost the tools and services I need. But sometimes there isn&amp;rsquo;t a service to selfhost. This was the case with my mysterious smart water meter which is now enforced by my municipality. After some research I found out that I might be able to get to my precious water data by using a radio dongle.</description>

      <title>Who needs a homelab</title>

      <description>In my second year at the Norwegian Tech &amp;amp; Natural Science University (NTNU) in Trondheim I joined DotKom. A subcommittee in the student organization which maintained the infrastructure and web services. One of the perks was that we were allowed to place one server in the University server room which had a gigabit internet line. Pretty amazing speeds in 2008. I was a poor student though, and didn&amp;rsquo;t have the cash to buy a server, so some of the more experienced DotKom members took me dumpster diving outside the various technical buildings.</description>

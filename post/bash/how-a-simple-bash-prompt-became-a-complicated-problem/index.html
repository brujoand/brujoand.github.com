<h1 id="a-small-need-for-a-more-informative-prompt">A small need for a more informative prompt</h1>
<p>This all started about 10 years ago when I was working as a Java consultant in
Oslo. We had just moved from SVN to git, and the concept of feature branches
was suddenly a thing. I hadn&rsquo;t really been very involved with VCS before git,
but now I felt like I understood it. (I didn&rsquo;t).
So I wanted to add the current git branch to my prompt. I quickly ended
up with something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>PS1<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;\u@\h:\w$(git status 2&gt;/dev/null | sed -n &#34;s/On branch \(.*\)/ [\1]/p&#34;) &#39;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This basically says that my prompt should be my &lsquo;my_user@my_host:my_working_dir&rsquo;
and if the git status command gives us data, insert the branch in [brackets].
Pretty simple, but with one gotcha. Notice that the value of the ´PS1´ variable is
enclosed in single quotes. This is because the ´PS1´ variable is evaluated when
printing the prompt. If I had used single quotes the subshell expression ´$()´
would have been evaluated only once and my git status would never have changed.</p>
<p>Anyway, I was quite content with this until one of my colleagues installed
<a href="https://ohmyz.sh/">oh-my-zsh</a> and I was blown away by how great it looked. I
quickly ditched my old prompt, installed zsh and installed one of the powerline
themes. It looked great, but I just didn&rsquo;t like zsh. To me it felt like moving
from Python to Ruby, everything was similar, but felt different in a fundamental
way. So everything that I&rsquo;d learned about Bash, suddenly didn&rsquo;t work the same anymore.
Every 3 years or so I try moving to zsh but always come back after a day or so.
I guess I&rsquo;m stuck here with Bash.</p>
<h1 id="the-quest-for-a-powerline-prompt-in-bash">The quest for a Powerline prompt in Bash</h1>
<p>I started searching for a bash equivalent of the powerline prompt and I
stumbled upon <a href="https://github.com/b-ryan/powerline-shell">powerline-shell</a>,
which looked perfect, but it was quite slow. It was also written in python,
which I found to be suboptimal as I wanted to be able to quickly add new
segments by just relying on the cli tools already available. Bash is great for
this.</p>
<p>After a while I gave up my search and tried making my own
<a href="https://github.com/brujoand/sbp">Simple Bash Prompt</a>. The first version was a
500 line shell script which was meant to be evaluated at the prompt draw time
like so ´PS1=&rsquo;$(generate_prompt $?)&lsquo;´. Basically call my ´generate_prompt´
function with the exit code of the last command as the only parameter. This
allowed me to change the appearance of the prompt based on the success or
failure of the previous command. As the project grew I added configuration
options, color schemes and predefined layouts. Below are some of the challenges
I&rsquo;ve been pulling my hair out over and how I solved them.</p>
<h1 id="the-sbp-requirements">The SBP requirements</h1>
<ul>
<li>It must render in less than 100ms (Preferably 50ms, less is more etc)</li>
<li>The code must be easy to read and test</li>
<li>The prompt must be easy to extend and adapt</li>
<li>The prompt should be reactive, meaning the layout could change if the screen
size shrinks.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="writing-clean-and-fast-code-in-bash">Writing clean and fast code in Bash</h1>
<p>A Bash prompt written in Bash makes sense if you want it to be portable and easy
to use. But 1000 lines of Bash is not very readable, and hard to maintain. So
you end up splitting logic up into re-usable functions and files that become small
libraries for functions with a similar use cases.</p>
<p>But every <code>variable=&quot;$(some_helper_function &quot;$my_var&quot;)&quot;</code> will create a subshell, and they
are expensive. On my Macbook Pro a subshell costs about 1 ms, on my raspberry
pi the price is 4 times higher. This is made worse by avoiding repetitive code,
a common best practice, which results in more subshells when using helper
functions instead of just repeating the logic.</p>
<p>So I ended up relying on pass by reference for returning values without spawing
a subshell. Example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># Returning value by referencing the $1 variable</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>add_numbers<span style="color:#f92672">()</span> <span style="color:#f92672">{</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  local -n add_numbers_result<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>$1
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  local first_number<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>$2
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  local second_number<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>$3
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  add_numbers_result<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">$((</span> first_number <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> second_number <span style="color:#66d9ef">))</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">}</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># Passing a variable for the return value</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print_numbers<span style="color:#f92672">()</span> <span style="color:#f92672">{</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  local my_added_numbers
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  add_numbers <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;my_added_numbers&#39;</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">22</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">33</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  echo <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;</span>$my_added_numbers<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">}</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print_numbers
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># The output will now be: 55</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>So to avoid making the code more magic than necessary a few conventions are
used. The first argument is always the name of the return value, and the return
variable is always called ´${name_of_function}_result´. The ´-n´ flag was added to
´local´ in Bash 4.3 and basically says &ldquo;create this variable and have it point to the variable
who&rsquo;s name is on the right hand side of the equal sign&rdquo;. It does make the code
less readable, and harder to follow, but this change alone reduced the execution
time from ~180ms to ~50ms. A substantial reduction in execution time.</p>
<p>Another cost is structuring code in separate files so that logically close
functions live together. This is again a &lsquo;clean code&rsquo; practice that will incur a
cost because now the file needs to be sourced every time it&rsquo;s needed, however this
cost is a lot lower and mainly affects readability as they file is read from
disk once and usually kept in memory. There already exists a
common best practice for this which I&rsquo;ve adopted. In a script file called
´execution.bash´ the function names will be prefixed with
´execution::${name_of_function}´. This makes it much easier to track down where
a function is defined, and it also avoids problems with naming collisions.</p>
<h1 id="concurrency-in-bash">Concurrency in Bash</h1>
<p>To be able to generate every segment of the prompt as quickly as possible,
concurrency is needed as just evaluating a simple function that checks some
environment variables and returns a string will hit 10ms easily. 10 of those and
we&rsquo;ve already hit our roof of 100ms.</p>
<p>Concurrency in Bash is easy if you just want to run a
bunch of jobs in the background and wait until they&rsquo;re finished. But if you care
about their exit status and output it becomes a bit more tricky.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-Bash" data-lang="Bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>  execute_segment_script <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;</span>$segment<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;</span>$direction<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;</span>$max_length<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;</span> &gt; <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;</span><span style="color:#e6db74">${</span>tempdir<span style="color:#e6db74">}</span><span style="color:#e6db74">/</span><span style="color:#e6db74">${</span>i<span style="color:#e6db74">}</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;</span> &amp; pids<span style="color:#f92672">[</span>i<span style="color:#f92672">]=</span>$!
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This obscurity is how I start a segment generation, output to a tempfile, and
store the pid in an array.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-Bash" data-lang="Bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> i in <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;</span><span style="color:#e6db74">${</span>!pids[@]<span style="color:#e6db74">}</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;</span>; <span style="color:#66d9ef">do</span>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#75715e"># Add it to the prompt</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#66d9ef">done</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This way we are more or less only bound by the speed of the slowest segment.
Ideally we would be able to wait on all pids and handle them one by one as they
exit, but I haven&rsquo;t found a way to do that. I&rsquo;ve tried using named pipes, and
have each concurrent segment write to it on completion, while a second process reads from the
pipe until all segments are done, but that was actually slower than the current
implementation. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/28358088/3503302">xargs</a> and
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/">Parallel</a> could have potentially helped
a bit by implementing a thread pool, but none of them really solves the
optimized waiting and output handling. In addition, Parallel is not available
everywhere. We also have
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Coprocesses.html">Coproc</a>
but in our case it doesn&rsquo;t really add anything that we don&rsquo;t already have in the
above solution.</p>
<h1 id="using-nohup-for-functions-you-want-to-fire-and-forget">Using nohup for functions you want to fire and forget</h1>
<p>So you might have seen someone do something like this ´nohup my_command &amp;´. The
command ´my_command´ is executed in the background and no longer attached to the
current shell, so it will live on even if our shell exits. This is great for
executing scripts, but as it will create a new bash process it will not have the
sourced functions from SBP available. Instead I found a neat trick on
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/54688673/3503302">StackOverflow</a> which lead to
this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>execute::nohup_function<span style="color:#f92672">()</span> <span style="color:#f92672">{</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#f92672">(</span>trap <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;&#39;</span> HUP INT
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;</span>$@<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#f92672">)</span> &lt;/dev/null &amp;&gt;&gt;<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;</span><span style="color:#e6db74">${</span>SBP_CONFIG<span style="color:#e6db74">}</span><span style="color:#e6db74">/hook.log&#34;</span> &amp;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This function will execute the command in a subshell, meaning our environment
and functions are still available. The trap signal will catch the SIGHUP and
SIGINT signals and ignore them. We disconnect our forked process from stdin by
pointing stdin to /dev/null. We point stderr and stdout to
´${SBP_CONFIG}/nohup.log´ and we mark this command to be executed
asynchronously with ´&amp;´. Pretty nifty.</p>
<h1 id="avoiding-external-commands">Avoiding external commands</h1>
<p>Another approach has been to remove the use of external programs in favor of
Bash builtins. This has added a lot of speed in many places as you can
usually replace most grep/sed/awk expressions with parameter expansion.
As an example consider replacing ´$HOME´ with ´~´ in your ´$PWD´:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span> ➜ time sed <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;s|</span>$HOME<span style="color:#e6db74">|\~|&#34;</span> <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;&lt;&lt;</span> $PWD
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>~/src/sbp
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>real 0m0.005s
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>user 0m0.001s
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>sys  0m0.003s
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> ➜ time echo <span style="color:#e6db74">${</span>PWD/<span style="color:#e6db74">${</span>HOME<span style="color:#e6db74">}</span>/<span style="color:#ae81ff">\~</span><span style="color:#e6db74">}</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>~/src/sbp
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>real 0m0.000s
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>user 0m0.000s
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>sys  0m0.000s
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>I&rsquo;d argue that this is both faster and more readable, although I&rsquo;ll admit that
parameter expansion is not always easy to read if you&rsquo;re not familiar with the
syntax. Note that I had to use ´|´ instead of ´/´ in the sed expression as my
´$HOME´ variable contains ´/´ slash which would have broken the sed syntax.
Also I&rsquo;ve used double quotes around the sed expression to allow for the use of
a shell variable and the ´&laquo;&lt; $variable´ expression let&rsquo;s sed treat our
variable as a file.</p>
<p>But for complicated search and replace like this sed to remove all color (and
surrounding escape brackets) it wasn&rsquo;t as straight forward.</p>

<h1 id="breaking-readline-by-accident-when-adding-colors">Breaking readline by accident when adding colors</h1>
<p>The above sed expression was necessary because I like having prompt segments
both on the left and right hand side of the screen. To do this I need to know
the length of the left and right segment strings and the width of the screen.
The problem though, is that if you try to calculate the length of a string which
contains escape sequences, strange things start to happen.</p>
<img src="/length_of_ps1.png" alt="length_of_ps1" width="75%"/>
<p>As you can see our ´PS1´ has a length of 746 which should be more than 7 rows
divided on our 103 character screen width. Obviously this is not what&rsquo;s
happening and when we print ´PS1´ we see that there are a bunch of escape
characters here. The expression ´\e[38;2;213;196;161m´ should be fairly
recognizable to most. The ´\e[´ (escape + bracket open) is called a &lsquo;Control
Sequence Introducer&rsquo; and tells the terminal that here comes a command where the
arguments are separated by &lsquo;;&rsquo;. The first number 38 means &lsquo;set foreground
color&rsquo;, 48 would be background color. The second number is 2 and means that we will
be printing an rgb color, a 5 would mean regular ansi color.
The three next values are the respective rgb values, or single ansi color value
if the previous value was 5. The sequence is terminated by the letter ´m´.</p>
<p>When we try to print the ´PS1´ variable with ´echo -e´ we will get the evaluated
values of the colors, but still there are unevaluated escapes in our output.
This is actually how
<a href="https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html">readline</a> keeps control
over the current cursor position on the screen when printing color sequences.
Every color definition needs to be surrounded by escapes so that readline
doesn&rsquo;t count it as a &lsquo;printed character&rsquo;. This means we need to print our color
like this: ´[\e[38;2;213;196;161m]´. Failing to take this into account will
cause weird problems like not being able to erase a command or suddenly have a
new line appear in the middle of tying.</p>
<p>The sed in the above section to remove escape sequences was slow, and had to be
executed on every generated segment to be able to calculate the size of the
segments and the distances between the left and right hand side. To avoid this
all together I ended up adding colors as the last step, after checking the
length of the uncolored segments. Much less magic, and much faster. Keep it
simple, stupid.</p>
<h1 id="figuring-out-how-long-the-previous-user-command-took">Figuring out how long the previous user command took</h1>
<p>So this was a tricky one and I started out doing something like so:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>command_start<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">$(</span>HISTTIMEFORMAT<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;%s &#39;</span> history <span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span> | awk <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;{print $2}&#39;</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">)</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>command_end<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">$(</span>date +%s<span style="color:#66d9ef">)</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>command_duration<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">$((</span> command_end <span style="color:#f92672">-</span> command_start <span style="color:#66d9ef">))</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This works pretty well as long as the previous command is actually committed to
history. In bash 4.4 we got the brand new ´PS0´ variable which is expanded right
before executing a command. So in SBP I added this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>  _sbp_pre_exec<span style="color:#f92672">()</span> <span style="color:#f92672">{</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    date +%s &gt; <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;</span><span style="color:#e6db74">${</span>SBP_TMP<span style="color:#e6db74">}</span><span style="color:#e6db74">/execution&#34;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#f92672">}</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  PS0<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;\$(_sbp_pre_exec)&#34;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We are basically just taking a timestamp and storing it, and we read it back
when we are about to draw the prompt. Here instead of using single quotes I
escaped the ´&amp;´ sign. This means the string will not contain the evaluated
value, but evaluating the string will execute the command. Just two ways of
doing the same thing.</p>
<h1 id="so-is-sbp-perfect-now">So is SBP perfect now?</h1>
<p>Probably not. SBP has improved as my understanding of Bash has improved,
greatly helped by <a href="https://www.shellcheck.net/">ShellCheck</a> btw which not only
tells me when I&rsquo;m wrong, but also <em>how</em> I&rsquo;m wrong and how to be right. My focus
now though is on getting more segments and making it easy to use. If you see
something that could have been done in a better, cleaner or more efficient way,
please send a PR or create an issue. :)</p>

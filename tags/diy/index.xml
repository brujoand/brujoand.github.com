      <description>After wanting one for many years, I finally pulled the trigger and bought a 3D printer as a birthday gift to myself. And it&amp;rsquo;s been a blast! I&amp;rsquo;ve printed everything I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten my hands on, but I have had this nagging feeling that I was just replicating, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t creating.
One (un)lucky day day though, my son broke the chain guard on is bike. I jumped on the chance to prove myself and took some quick notes and then took a photo of it because paper always magically disappears for me.</description>

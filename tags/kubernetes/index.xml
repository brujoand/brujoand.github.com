      <description>A sudden urge to upgrade It was a warm spring day, kids were out of the house, I had just finished a round of Rocket League and I thought; Maybe I should upgrade my kubernetes cluster?
My homelab cluster is deployed using Kubespray which works by coordinating a myriad of Ansible scripts. It&amp;rsquo;s not the quickest solution, but it&amp;rsquo;s solid and customizable. These upgrades are usually quite uneventful, but I wanted to make some larger changes to how my gitops flow works, so I decided to just wipe everything after backing up all my volumes and start from scratch.</description>

      <description>One major difference between running k8s in a corporate setting vs running in a homelab is the extreme amount of custom hardware you end up wanting to put into the cluster. But this isn&amp;rsquo;t really how k8s was meant to be used. Any workload should be able to run anywhere, and be killed at any time and pop back up again. At least, for the most part. But I wanted to do some machine learning in my cluster using Google Coral TPU.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t like having to relying on other people&amp;rsquo;s computers, aka the cloud, so when I can I selfhost the tools and services I need. But sometimes there isn&amp;rsquo;t a service to selfhost. This was the case with my mysterious smart water meter which is now enforced by my municipality. After some research I found out that I might be able to get to my precious water data by using a radio dongle.</description>

      <description>In my second year at the Norwegian Tech &amp;amp; Natural Science University (NTNU) in Trondheim I joined DotKom. A subcommittee in the student organization which maintained the infrastructure and web services. One of the perks was that we were allowed to place one server in the University server room which had a gigabit internet line. Pretty amazing speeds in 2008. I was a poor student though, and didn&amp;rsquo;t have the cash to buy a server, so some of the more experienced DotKom members took me dumpster diving outside the various technical buildings.</description>

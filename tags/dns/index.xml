      <description>A sudden urge to upgrade It was a warm spring day, kids were out of the house, I had just finished a round of Rocket League and I thought; Maybe I should upgrade my kubernetes cluster?
My homelab cluster is deployed using Kubespray which works by coordinating a myriad of Ansible scripts. It&amp;rsquo;s not the quickest solution, but it&amp;rsquo;s solid and customizable. These upgrades are usually quite uneventful, but I wanted to make some larger changes to my gitops flow, so I decided to just wipe everything after backing up all my volumes and start from scratch.</description>

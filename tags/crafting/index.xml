      <description>The need for air sensing I had a conversation with my wife about ventilation that went something like this:
I have a soft spot for buying sensors and gadgets at night when I&amp;rsquo;m supposed to go to sleep. Always thinking that &amp;ldquo;Oh, this could be a cool addition If I ever do that project idea&amp;rdquo;. I love the idea of making IOT devices myself as they are often cheaper and much better at privacy and security as there is no cloud exposure.</description>

      <description>After wanting one for many years, I finally pulled the trigger and bought a 3D printer as a birthday gift to myself. And it&amp;rsquo;s been a blast! I&amp;rsquo;ve printed everything I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten my hands on, but I have had this nagging feeling that I was just replicating, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t creating.
One (un)lucky day though, my son broke the chain guard on is bike. I jumped on the chance to prove myself and took some quick notes and measurements.</description>
